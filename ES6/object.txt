ES6 allows 
- to use variabls as property name
- to have spaces in property name

Example 
let ln = "last name",
emp = {
    "first name" : "Jack",
    [ln] : "Joseph"                 //variable should be enclosed in square bracket
}

console.log(emp["first name"])      //use square bracket to access obj property with spaces for ex. here "first name"
console.log(emp)
