        /* Note 
            -   functional programming technique, developed by American Mathematician Haskell Curry thats why called as 'Currying'
            -   transformation of function with multiple arguments into several functions with single argument in a sequence
            -   basically, wrapping a function inside other function 

            Advantages
            -   helps avoid passing same variable multiple times 
            -   helps to create a higher order function

            # Higher order function (HOF) -> is a function that accepts function as parameters and/or returns a function as a result
                -   advantage is reusability which is primarily used in array methods like map, reduce 
                eg : map, reduce, currying etc

            # Function Composition -> result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed tp another function until the final funtion is executed the final result
