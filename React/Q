# What is React / advantages
- open source JS lib
- uses virtual DOM instead of Real which improves efficiency.
- uses reusable/compoable components to build UI
- SEO friendly
- freedom to choose tools, libraries and architecture for developing

# What is useState()
- built in React hook
- Should be used when the DOM is changing dynamically

    Example :
        function Button(){
            const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)
            return <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>{counter}</button>
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<Button />, document.getElementById("mountNode"))  

# What are keys in React
- string attribute that needs to be included when using lists of elements
- provides a unique identity for each element
- With Keys, React has an idea of which particular element was added/ changed / deleted
- Without Keys, React doesn't understand the order or uniquness of each element
- Avoid using Array index as the key

# What is JSX
- stands for JavaScript XML
- allows to write HTML inside JS

    Example :
    # without JSX
    const text = React.createElement('div', {}, 'Hello World')
    ReactDOM.render(text, rootElement)

    # with JSX
    const text = (
        <div>Hello World</div>
    )
    ReactDOM.render(text, rootElement)


# React Hooks
- useState
- useEffect
